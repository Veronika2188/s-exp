# Traits and Structures

### What are Traits?

Traits are similar to interfaces but can also include method implementations.

### Scala

**Example:**

```scala
sealed trait SExp {
  def toString: String
}
```

-   `SExp` is a trait that defines the `toString` method.
-   In the `Parser.scala` file, the `SExp` trait defines the `toString` method.

### C

**Example:**

```c
typedef struct SExp {
    char* type;
    void* value;
} SExp;
```

-   This C code shows how a struct is used to define an S-expression.
-   In the `parser.c` file, the `SExp` struct is defined with fields for `type` and `value`.

### Go

**Example:**

```go
type Atom struct {
	value string
}
```

-   Here, `Atom` is a struct that has a field `value` of type `string`.
-   In the `parser.go` file, the `Atom` struct is defined with a field for `value`.

### Lisp

**Example:**

```lisp
(defstruct sexp
  (type nil)
  (value nil))
```

-   Here, `sexp` is a structure that has fields `type` and `value`.
-   In the `parser.lisp` file, the `sexp` structure is defined with fields for `type` and `value`.

### What are Structures?

Structures are user-defined data types that group together variables of different types.

### C

**Example:**

```c
typedef struct SExp {
    char* type;
    void* value;
} SExp;
```

-   This C code shows how a struct is used to define an S-expression.

### Comparison of Interfaces/Classes with Traits

-   **Interfaces:** Define a contract that classes must adhere to, specifying methods and properties. They do not provide implementation details.
-   **Classes:** Define the structure and behavior of objects, including both data and methods. They can implement interfaces.
-   **Traits:** Similar to interfaces but can also include method implementations. They allow for code reuse and composition. Traits can be used to add functionality to existing types without modifying the types themselves.

In languages like Scala, traits can be mixed into classes, allowing for a form of multiple inheritance. In other languages, traits may be called mixins or protocols.

### C++

C++ uses structs and classes to define structures.

**Example:**

```cpp
struct SExp {
    std::string type;
    void* value;
};
```

-   `SExp` is a struct that has fields for `type` and `value`.

### C#

C# uses structs to define structures.

**Example:**

```csharp
public struct SExp
{
    public string Type { get; }
    public object Value { get; }

    public SExp(string type, object value)
    {
        Type = type;
        Value = value;
    }
}
```

-   `SExp` is a struct that has properties for `Type` and `Value`.

### Dart

Dart uses classes to define structures.

**Example:**

```dart
class SExp {
  final String type;
  final dynamic value;
  SExp(this.type, this.value);
}
```

-   `SExp` is a class that has fields for `type` and `value`.

### Kotlin

Kotlin uses data classes to define structures.

**Example:**

```kotlin
data class SExp(val type: String, val value: Any)
```

-   `SExp` is a data class that has properties for `type` and `value`.

### Python

Python uses classes to define structures.

**Example:**

```python
class SExp:
    def __init__(self, type, value):
        self.type = type
        self.value = value
```

-   `SExp` is a class that has fields for `type` and `value`.

### Haskell

Haskell uses data types to define structures.

**Example:**

```haskell
data SExp = Atom String | SList [SExp]
```

-   `SExp` is a data type that can be either an `Atom` or an `SList`.

### OCaml

OCaml uses records to define structures.

**Example:**

```ocaml
type sexp =
  | Atom of string
  | SList of sexp list
```

-   `sexp` is a type that can be either an `Atom` or an `SList`.

### Rust

Rust uses structs to define structures.

**Example:**

```rust
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
enum SExp {
    Atom(String),
    SList(Vec<SExp>),
}
```

-   `SExp` is an enum that can be either an `Atom` or an `SList`.

### Clojure

Clojure uses records to define structures.

**Example:**

```clojure
(defrecord SExp [type value])
```

-   `SExp` is a record that has fields for `type` and `value`.

### F#

F# uses records to define structures.

**Example:**

```fsharp
type SExp = {
    Type: string
    Value: obj
}
```

-   `SExp` is a record that has fields for `Type` and `Value`.
