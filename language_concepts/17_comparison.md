# Comparison of Languages

### Similarities

-   All languages implement the core parsing logic using a recursive descent approach.
-   All languages use functions or methods to tokenize the input string.
-   All languages use some form of data structure to represent S-expressions (classes, case classes, structs, etc.).

### Differences

-   **Typing:** TypeScript, Scala, and Swift are statically-typed, while Python is dynamically-typed.
-   **Syntax:** Each language has its own syntax for defining classes, functions, and other language constructs.
-   **Features:** Scala and Swift use ADTs and pattern matching extensively, while TypeScript uses interfaces and classes. Python uses dynamic typing and classes.

## Conclusion

The S-expression parser implementations demonstrate various language concepts across different programming languages. While the core logic remains similar, each language uses its own syntax and features to achieve the same result. Understanding these concepts is crucial for writing effective code in each language. The choice of language depends on the specific requirements and preferences of the developer.
