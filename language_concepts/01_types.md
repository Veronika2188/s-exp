# Types

### What are Types?

In programming, types classify values and determine what operations can be performed on them. They help ensure code correctness and prevent errors.

### TypeScript

TypeScript is a statically-typed language, meaning types are checked at compile time. It uses explicit type annotations.

**Example:**

```typescript
function createAtom(value: string): SExp {
    return {
        type: 'atom',
        value: value,
        toString: () => value,
    };
}
```

-   Here, `value` is explicitly typed as `string`, and the function `createAtom` is declared to return a value of type `SExp`.
-   In the `parser.ts` file, the `SExp` interface defines the structure of an S-expression:
    ```typescript
    interface SExp {
        type: string;
        value: any;
        toString(): string;
    }
    ```
    The `createAtom` function returns an object that conforms to this interface.

### JavaScript

JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, meaning types are checked at runtime. Variables do not have explicit type declarations.

**Example:**

```javascript
class Atom extends SExp {
    constructor(value) {
        super();
        this.value = value;
    }

    toString() {
        return this.value;
    }
}
```

-   Here, `value` is not explicitly typed. JavaScript determines the type of `value` at runtime based on the assigned value.
-   In the `parser.js` file, the `Atom` class has a constructor that takes a value, but the type of the value is not specified.


### Scala

Scala is also statically-typed and uses both explicit type annotations and type inference.

**Example:**

```scala
case class Atom(value: String) extends SExp {
  override def toString: String = value
}
```

-   Here, `value` is explicitly typed as `String`. Scala can also infer types in many cases, reducing the need for explicit annotations.

### Swift

Swift is a statically-typed language that uses type inference and explicit type annotations.

**Example:**

```swift
class Atom: SExp {
    let value: String
    init(value: String) {
        self.value = value
    }
    func toString() -> String {
        return value
    }
}
```

-   Here, `value` is explicitly typed as `String`. Swift also uses type inference to determine types when they are not explicitly declared.

### Python

Python is a dynamically-typed language, meaning types are checked at runtime. Variables do not have explicit type declarations.

**Example:**

```python
class Atom(SExp):
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.value)
```

-   Here, `value` is not explicitly typed. Python determines the type of `value` at runtime based on the assigned value.
-   In the `parser.py` file, the `Atom` class has a constructor that takes a value, but the type of the value is not specified.

### Scala

Scala is also statically-typed and uses both explicit type annotations and type inference.

**Example:**

```scala
case class Atom(value: String) extends SExp {
  override def toString: String = value
}
```

-   Here, `value` is explicitly typed as `String`. Scala can also infer types in many cases, reducing the need for explicit annotations.
-   In the `Parser.scala` file, the `Atom` case class has a constructor that takes a `String` value.

### Swift

Swift is a statically-typed language that uses type inference and explicit type annotations.

**Example:**

```swift
class Atom: SExp {
    let value: String
    init(value: String) {
        self.value = value
    }
    func toString() -> String {
        return value
    }
}
```

-   Here, `value` is explicitly typed as `String`. Swift also uses type inference to determine types when they are not explicitly declared.
-   In the `parser.swift` file, the `Atom` class has a constructor that takes a `String` value.

### C++

C++ is a statically-typed language that uses explicit type annotations.

**Example:**

```cpp
class Atom : public SExp {
public:
    std::string value;
    Atom(std::string value) : value(value) {}
    std::string toString() override {
        return value;
    }
};
```

-   Here, `value` is explicitly typed as `std::string`.

### C#

C# is a statically-typed language that uses explicit type annotations.

**Example:**

```csharp
public class Atom : SExp
{
    public string Value { get; }

    public Atom(string value)
    {
        Value = value;
    }

    public override string ToString()
    {
        return Value;
    }
}
```

-   Here, `value` is explicitly typed as `string`.

### Dart

Dart is a statically-typed language that uses explicit type annotations.

**Example:**

```dart
class Atom extends SExp {
  final String value;
  Atom(this.value);

  @override
  String toString() {
    return value;
  }
}
```

-   Here, `value` is explicitly typed as `String`.

### Kotlin

Kotlin is a statically-typed language that uses explicit type annotations and type inference.

**Example:**

```kotlin
class Atom(val value: String) : SExp() {
    override fun toString(): String {
        return value
    }
}
```

-   Here, `value` is explicitly typed as `String`.

### Go

Go is a statically-typed language that uses explicit type declarations.

**Example:**

```go
type Atom struct {
	value string
}
```

-   Here, `value` is explicitly typed as `string`.

### Haskell

Haskell is a statically-typed language that uses type inference.

**Example:**

```haskell
data SExp = Atom String | SList [SExp]
```

-   Here, `String` is the type of the value in the `Atom` constructor.

### OCaml

OCaml is a statically-typed language that uses type inference.

**Example:**

```ocaml
type sexp =
  | Atom of string
  | SList of sexp list
```

-   Here, `string` is the type of the value in the `Atom` constructor.

### Rust

Rust is a statically-typed language that uses explicit type annotations.

**Example:**

```rust
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
enum SExp {
    Atom(String),
    SList(Vec<SExp>),
}
```

-   Here, `String` is the type of the value in the `Atom` variant.

(defstruct sexp
  (type nil)
  (value nil))

(defun make-atom (value)
  (make-sexp :type 'atom :value value))
```

-   Here, `value` is not explicitly typed.

### What are Types?

In programming, types classify values and determine what operations can be performed on them. They help ensure code correctness and prevent errors.

### TypeScript

TypeScript is a statically-typed language, meaning types are checked at compile time. It uses explicit type annotations.

**Example:**

```typescript
function createAtom(value: string): SExp {
    return {
        type: 'atom',
        value: value,
        toString: () => value,
    };
}
```

-   Here, `value` is explicitly typed as `string`, and the function `createAtom` is declared to return a value of type `SExp`.
-   In the `parser.ts` file, the `SExp` interface defines the structure of an S-expression:
    ```typescript
    interface SExp {
        type: string;
        value: any;
        toString(): string;
    }
    ```
    The `createAtom` function returns an object that conforms to this interface.

### JavaScript

JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, meaning types are checked at runtime. Variables do not have explicit type declarations.

**Example:**

```javascript
class Atom extends SExp {
    constructor(value) {
        super();
        this.value = value;
    }

    toString() {
        return this.value;
    }
}
```

-   Here, `value` is not explicitly typed. JavaScript determines the type of `value` at runtime based on the assigned value.
-   In the `parser.js` file, the `Atom` class has a constructor that takes a value, but the type of the value is not specified.


### Scala

Scala is also statically-typed and uses both explicit type annotations and type inference.

**Example:**

```scala
case class Atom(value: String) extends SExp {
  override def toString: String = value
}
```

-   Here, `value` is explicitly typed as `String`. Scala can also infer types in many cases, reducing the need for explicit annotations.

    }
    func toString() -> String {
        return value
    }
}
```

-   Here, `value` is explicitly typed as `String`. Swift also uses type inference to determine types when they are not explicitly declared.
